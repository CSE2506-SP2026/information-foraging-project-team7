      <section id="philosophy">
        <p>At Washington University Nursery School, we believe that children are unique individuals with their own patterns and timetables for social, emotional, intellectual, and physical development. We support and encourage their development through our child-centered, process-oriented, play-based curriculum built on Constructivist theories and practices. Guided by the teachings of educational theorists including Piaget, Dewey, Vygotsky, DeVries, and others, we create a learning environment that addresses the developmental needs of the whole child by:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Structuring classroom experiences around ideas and topics that are relevant to the students, with the understanding that knowledge is constructed through language, discussion, experimentation, and manipulation of objects that are meaningful to them</li>
          <li>Offering hands-on learning experiences that use a variety of materials, engage multiple senses, and encourage exploration, investigation, and learning</li>
          <li>Allowing each child to interact with the environment at his/her own pace, and creating opportunities for children to explore individually, with a partner, or with a larger group of peers</li>
          <li>Asking open-ended questions, allowing students the time to thoughtfully form responses, listening respectfully to their replies, and gently guiding them toward the answers they seek as they develop enhanced reasoning skills</li>
          <li>Respecting students’ ideas, encouraging independent thinking, and empowering students to become problem solvers</li>
          <li>Using the wonderful resource of our diverse, multi-cultural population to highlight the similarities and differences between individuals, families, and cultures, celebrating the unique environment that is Washington University Nursery School.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Washington University Nursery School’s open curriculum framework is presented in ways that are developmentally appropriate and based on our philosophy that children learn most effectively through play. Using a learning center approach, each teaching team offers experiences in art, writing, science, dramatic play, blocks, manipulatives, and literacy. Teacher planning takes into account the social, emotional, intellectual, and physical developmental needs of each child.</p>

        <h2>Visual Arts</h2>
        <p>At Washington University Nursery School we offer children many opportunities to express themselves creatively and artistically. We value visual arts, music, and dramatic play as important building blocks in constructing learning. In the visual arts, the emphasis is on the process of exploring materials and how they can be manipulated, rather than the product of those manipulations. We allow children the time, space, and freedom necessary to achieve a successful and complete experience. These art experiences, whether undertaken independently or as part of a group, can help increase a child’s attention span, improve fine motor skills, strengthen confidence and emotional well-being while building independence.</p>
        <p>Materials and experiences include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Drawing with crayons, pencils, chalk, markers, sidewalk chalk</li>
          <li>Painting with fingers, brushes, feathers, sponges, leaves, vegetables, and other materials and items</li>
          <li>Printmaking with rubber stamps, potato shapes, and various other objects</li>
          <li>Working with clay and doughs used for shaping, building, and modeling</li>
          <li>Cutting, tearing, gluing, and stapling</li>
          <li>Shaping/forming and stringing beads</li>
          <li>Creating collages from any combination of fabrics, paper, pictures, and a variety of three-dimensional items</li>
          <li>Building 3-dimensional constructions using boxes, paper tubes, cartons, and other recyclable materials</li>
          <li>Creating pictures or structures using wire, clay, wood and other materials</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <p>Students at Washington University Nursery School enjoy exploring visual arts, music and drama with specialists in these areas, in addition to the artistic opportunities that abound as part of their everyday curriculum in the classroom and on the playground.</p>
