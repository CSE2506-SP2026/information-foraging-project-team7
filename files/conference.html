          The teachers at Washington University Nursery School observe and assess children’s progress on 
          an ongoing basis. Teachers consistently plan and adapt experiences within the curriculum to 
          meet students’ needs.
        </p>

      <section id="curriculum-adaptation">
        <p>
          If one or more children need help in a specific area, the curriculum may be adapted in a variety 
          of ways, which may include:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Offering more one-on-one teacher-student time to understand the child’s thinking process, build trust, and increase student confidence</li>
          <li>Offering more opportunities for exploration</li>
          <li>Simplifying an activity by removing stimuli</li>
          <li>Expanding an activity by adding components for exploration</li>
          <li>Appealing to different senses and ways of exploring materials than previously used in order to engage different parts of the brain in the learning process</li>
          <li>Planning individual, small group, and/or large group activities around a particular concept, skill, or area of concern</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
      </section>

      <section id="conferences">
        <p>
          Parent/teacher conferences are held twice a year (Fall and Spring). Teachers take note of 
          students’ activities throughout the year in order to learn about each child, plan for individual and 
          group needs, and communicate with parents on an ongoing basis.
        </p>
        <p>
          The <strong>Fall conference</strong> is informal – teachers meet with parents, relate to them the activities and progress of their child, 
          and answer any questions they may have regarding their child’s learning experiences.
        </p>
        <p>
          The <strong>Spring conference</strong> is more formal – teachers fill out an assessment form covering all areas of the 
          curriculum, including personal observations, in order to provide a well-rounded picture of each 
          child. The assessment is sent home before the scheduled conference so that parents have time to 
          read and understand the material, and form questions they may have prior to the actual meeting.
